    RemoteELFMemExec
</h1>

**RemoteELFMemExec** is a tool designed to download, decrypt, and execute ELF binaries directly in memory from a remote URL. This utility enables the execution of executable files without writing them to disk, leveraging memory-based execution for enhanced stealth and efficiency. The tool uses XOR encryption to securely decrypt the ELF binary before execution.

Additionally, **RemoteELFMemExec** allows specifying a process name similar to `exec -a`, which facilitates process camouflage and helps it appear as a legitimate process.


> **⚠️ Warning:** On legacy systems, such as CentOS 6, it is not possible to execute ELF files directly in memory due to the lack of support for the `memfd_create` function, introduced in Linux 3.17. In these environments, the process downloads the encrypted ELF file to disk, decrypts it, executes it, and then deletes it.



## Compilation

### Requirements

Before compiling, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- `gcc`
- `make`
- `libcurl4-openssl-dev`


### Debug Mode
```bash

make

```
**⚠️ Warning:** To enable static compilation, you must compile `lcurl` as a static library.
### Static Compilation
```bash

make  static

```
### Legacy Systems
```bash

make  legacy

```
### Static Compilation for Legacy Systems
```bash

make  legacy_static

```
## Usage
