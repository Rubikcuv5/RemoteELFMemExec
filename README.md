# RemoteELFMemExec
RemoteELFMemExec is a tool that downloads, decrypts, and executes ELF binaries directly in memory from a remote URL. This utility enables running executable files without writing them to disk, leveraging memory-based execution for enhanced stealth and efficiency. The tool uses XOR encryption to securely decrypt the ELF binary before execution.
